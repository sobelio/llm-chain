# llm-chain üöÄ

`llm-chain` is a collection of Rust crates designed to help you work with Large Language Models (LLMs) more effectively. Our primary focus is on providing robust support for prompt templates and chaining together prompts in multi-step chains, enabling complex tasks that LLMs can't handle in a single step. This includes, but is not limited to, summarizing lengthy texts or performing advanced data processing tasks.

## Examples üí°

To help you get started, here is an example demonstrating how to use `llm-chain`. You can find more examples in the [examples folder](/llm-chain-openai/examples) in the repository.

```rust
let exec = Executor::new_default();
let res = Step::for_prompt(prompt!(
    "You are a robot assistant for making personalized greetings",
    "Make a personalized greeting for Joe"
))
.run(&Parameters::new(), &exec)
.await?;
println!("{}", res);
```

## Features üåü

- **Prompt templates**: Create reusable and easily customizable prompt templates for consistent and structured interactions with LLMs.
- **Chains**: Build powerful chains of prompts that allow you to execute more complex tasks, step by step, leveraging the full potential of LLMs.
- **ChatGPT support**: Supports ChatGPT models, with plans to add OpenAI's other models in the future.
- **LLaMa support**: Provides seamless integration with LLaMa models, enabling natural language understanding and generation tasks with Facebook's research models.
- **Alpaca support**: Incorporates support for Stanford's Alpaca models, expanding the range of available language models for advanced AI applications.
- **Tools**: Enhance your AI agents' capabilities by giving them access to various tools, such as running Bash commands, executing Python scripts, or performing web searches, enabling more complex and powerful interactions.
- **Extensibility**: Designed with extensibility in mind, making it easy to integrate additional LLMs as the ecosystem grows.
- **Community-driven**: We welcome and encourage contributions from the community to help improve and expand the capabilities of `llm-chain`.

## Getting Started üöÄ

To start using `llm-chain`, add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
llm-chain = "0.1.0"
llm-chain-openai = "0.1.0
```

The examples for `llm-chain-openai` require you to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable which you can do like this:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-YOUR_OPEN_AI_KEY_HERE"
```

Then, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.rs/llm-chain) and [examples](/llm-chain-openai/examples) to learn how to create prompt templates, chains, and more.
