They keep track of the conversation history and manage the context, ensuring that the LLM\'s responses remain relevant and coherent throughout the conversation. Conversational chains are particularly useful for chatbot applications, multi-step interactions, and any scenario where context is essential.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"chains/map-reduce-chains":{"id":"chains/map-reduce-chains","title":"Map-Reduce Chains","description":"Map-Reduce chains are a powerful way to process large amounts of text using large language models (LLMs). They consist of two main steps: a \\"map\\" step, which processes each text chunk independently, and a \\"reduce\\" step, which combines the results of the map step into a single output. This approach enables the efficient processing of large documents that exceed the LLM\'s context window size.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"chains/sequential-chains":{"id":"chains/sequential-chains","title":"sequential-chains","description":"Sequential Chains","sidebar":"sidebar"},"chains/what-are-chains":{"id":"chains/what-are-chains","title":"What are LLM chains and why are they useful?","description":"Chains are a concept in the world of language models designed to model common patterns for applying large language models (LLMs) to a sequence of tasks. Although the term \\"chain\\" might suggest that it strictly involves chaining together LLM steps, the name has stuck, and it is now used more broadly.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"dev-setup":{"id":"dev-setup","title":"Development Setup","description":"First of all, thank you for considering contributing to our project! \ud83c\udf89 We are delighted to have you here and truly appreciate your interest in making our project even better.
