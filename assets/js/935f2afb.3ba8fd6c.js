They keep track of the conversation history and manage the context, ensuring that the LLM\'s responses remain relevant and coherent throughout the conversation. Conversational chains are particularly useful for chatbot applications, multi-step interactions, and any scenario where context is essential.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"chains/map-reduce-chains":{"id":"chains/map-reduce-chains","title":"Map-Reduce Chains","description":"Map-Reduce chains are a powerful way to process large amounts of text using large language models (LLMs). They consist of two main steps: a \\"map\\" step, which processes each text chunk independently, and a \\"reduce\\" step, which combines the results of the map step into a single output. This approach enables the efficient processing of large documents that exceed the LLM\'s context window size.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"chains/sequential-chains":{"id":"chains/sequential-chains","title":"sequential-chains","description":"Sequential Chains","sidebar":"sidebar"},"chains/what-are-chains":{"id":"chains/what-are-chains","title":"What are LLM chains and why are they useful?","description":"Chains are a concept in the world of language models designed to model common patterns for applying large language models (LLMs) to a sequence of tasks.

This series of articles will guide you through the process of installing, setting up, and using the llm-chain library to make cool applications for LLMs. As you progress through the tutorials, you\'ll learn about generating text, using prompt templates, creating sequential chains, and summarizing text with map-reduce. We hope these tutorials provide you with a solid foundation to build upon and inspire you to create unique and innovative solutions using llm-chain.

Our primary focus is on providing robust support for prompt templates and chaining together prompts in multi-step chains, enabling complex tasks that LLMs can\'t handle in a single step. This includes, but is not limited to, summarizing lengthy texts or performing advanced data processing tasks.","sidebar":"sidebar"}}}')}}]);
