{{History of Bougainville}}
```
A non-binding [independence
referendum](independence_referendum "wikilink") was held in
[Bougainville](Autonomous_Region_of_Bougainville "wikilink"),[^1] an
autonomous [region](Provinces_of_Papua_New_Guinea "wikilink") of [Papua
New Guinea](Papua_New_Guinea "wikilink"), between 23 November and 7
December 2019. The referendum question was a choice between greater
autonomy within Papua New Guinea and full independence; voters voted
overwhelmingly (98.31%) for independence.

The referendum was a result of a 2001 agreement between the government
of Papua New Guinea and the [Autonomous Bougainville
Government](Autonomous_Bougainville_Government "wikilink") that ended a
[civil war](Bougainville_Civil_War "wikilink") fought from 1988 to 1998.
The vote is non-binding and the [government of Papua New
Guinea](government_of_Papua_New_Guinea "wikilink") has the final
authority of decision on the political status of Bougainville. Observers
have said that the clear result makes it difficult for Papua New Guinea
to ignore or delay the result, but that independence could take years to
achieve.

In July 2021, an agreement was reached between the governments of Papua
New Guinea and Bougainville, in which Bougainville will gain
independence by 2027[^2] if it is ratified by Papua New Guinea\'s
parliament.[^3]

## Background

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Bougainville Civil War}}
```
Discussions about an independent Bougainville had been held as early as
1968. Following a meeting in [Port Moresby](Port_Moresby "wikilink")
between the two Bougainville MHAs ([Paul Lapun](Paul_Lapun "wikilink")
and Donatus Mola) and around 25 Bougainvilleans, a proposal was put
forward in the [House of
Assembly](House_of_Assembly_of_Papua_and_New_Guinea "wikilink") to hold
a referendum to decide whether the island should remain part of Papua
New Guinea, join the [Solomon Islands](Solomon_Islands "wikilink"), or
become independent.[^4] However, no vote was held. After Papua New
Guinea became independent from Australia in 1975,[^5] Bougainville was
given provincial status in 1976.[^6]

In 1988, tensions erupted into a civil war between the [Bougainville
Revolutionary Army](Bougainville_Revolutionary_Army "wikilink") and
Papua New Guinea government forces.[^7] One key issue was the [Panguna
mine](Panguna_mine "wikilink"), which closed in 1989.[^8] The civil war
ended with a ceasefire in 1998, followed with the 2001 Bougainville
Peace Agreement.[^9] The agreement established the Autonomous
Bougainville Government,[^10] and mandated a referendum on the
independence of Bougainville to be held 10--15 years after the election
of the first Autonomous Bougainville Government, which was slated to be
June 2020 at the latest.[^11] The referendum would be
[non-binding](Non-binding_resolution "wikilink"), and the final decision
would rest with the Papua New Guinean government.[^12][^13]

In November 2019, [Raymond Masono](Raymond_Masono "wikilink"),
[Vice-President of the Autonomous Region of
Bougainville](Vice-President_of_the_Autonomous_Region_of_Bougainville "wikilink"),
campaigned that he would plan to reopen the [Panguna
mine](Panguna_mine "wikilink") if the referendum resulted in a vote for
independence. Panguna had closed in 1989 due to the civil war and is now
estimated to hold copper worth up to \$60 billion. With independence,
all of Papua New Guinea\'s interests in the mine would transfer to
Bougainville, giving it a 60% share in all projects and retaining all
mining licences. The remaining 40% would be left for investors to bid
on.[^14]

## Planning

The vote was originally scheduled for 15 June 2019,[^15] but was delayed
to 17 October amid allegations that the national government was slow to
provide most of the promised funding for the referendum.[^16] The
referendum was delayed again to 23 November at the request of the
Bougainville Referendum Commission to ensure the credibility of the
referendum roll so more people can vote. Both governments said this
delay would be the last.[^17] Voting was planned to take place over two
weeks, from 23 November to 7 December.[^18]

The vote faced a high degree of difficulty to organise, with most of the
population in small hamlets and villages, and about half the population
being illiterate.[^19]

In October 2018, former [Taoiseach of Ireland](Taoiseach "wikilink")
[Bertie Ahern](Bertie_Ahern "wikilink") was appointed to chair the
Bougainville Referendum Commission, which was responsible for preparing
the referendum.[^20]

### Voters

In November, the BRC completed the official \"certified voter list\" to
be used in polling for the referendum.[^21] The final number of eligible
voters was 206,731, out of a total population of nearly 300,000.[^22]
Males undergoing the [upe](upe "wikilink") rite of passage were allowed
to vote at special male-only polling stations.[^23] Bougainvilleans
living in other parts of Papua New Guinea, or in Australia and Solomon
Islands, were also allowed to vote.[^24]

### Question

The question put to voters was:

```{=mediawiki}
{{Blockquote|Do you agree for Bougainville to have: (1) Greater Autonomy (2) Independence?<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/368565/question-agreed-for-bougainville-s-independence-referendum|title=Question agreed for Bougainville's independence referendum|date=2018-10-13|work=Radio New Zealand|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en-nz|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181019121923/https://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/368565/question-agreed-for-bougainville-s-independence-referendum|archive-date=19 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>}}
```
## Results

The results of the referendum were announced on 11 December. Over 98% of
valid ballots were cast in favor of independence.[^26][^27] Prior to the
election, it was widely expected that the independence option would
win,[^28][^29][^30][^31] with *[The Guardian](The_Guardian "wikilink")*
reporting an estimate of 90% in favor of independence.[^32]

An official reported that the referendum went \"better than we
expected,\" and that voters were enthusiastic,[^33] while observers from
[Divine Word University](Divine_Word_University "wikilink") said that
the voting took place in an atmosphere of celebration.[^34]

}}`{=mediawiki}

On 24 January 2020, the result was declared \"Petition Free\",
confirming that no appeals had been received within 40 days against the
conduct or the result of the referendum and that none could be accepted
in future.[^35] On the same day, the December result was commended by
the Referendum Commission to the governments and the referendum process
formally closed.[^36]

## Aftermath

Following the announcements of the result, [John
Momis](John_Momis "wikilink"), [President of the Autonomous Region of
Bougainville](President_of_the_Autonomous_Region_of_Bougainville "wikilink"),
said, \"at least psychologically, we feel liberated.\" Papua New
Guinea\'s Minister for Bougainville Affairs [Puka
Temu](Puka_Temu "wikilink") said, \"the outcome is a credible one,\" but
also stated that Papua New Guinea should have time to absorb the
result.[^37] As the referendum was non-binding, independence will need
to be negotiated between leaders from Bougainville and Papua New Guinea.
The final decision on Bougainville\'s status depends on the [National
Parliament of Papua New
Guinea](National_Parliament_of_Papua_New_Guinea "wikilink"). Rod McGuirk
of *[Time](Time_(magazine) "wikilink")* noted that \"the process of
becoming a separate nation could take years to achieve.\"[^38]

Papua New Guinean Prime Minister [James Marape](James_Marape "wikilink")
acknowledged the referendum results and stated that he would only commit
his government to develop \"a road map that leads to a lasting peace
settlement\" in consultation with Bougainville authorities. Papuan New
Guinean officials were concerned that Bougainvillean independence would
set a precedent for copycat secession movements in other
[provinces](Provinces_of_Papua_New_Guinea "wikilink") such as [East New
Britain](East_New_Britain_Province "wikilink"), [New
Ireland](New_Ireland_Province "wikilink"), and
[Enga](Enga_Province "wikilink").[^39]

Jonathan Pryke, director of the Pacific Islands program at the [Lowy
Institute](Lowy_Institute "wikilink") in Sydney, stated that the
referendum\'s results were disadvantageous for Papua New Guinea, adding
that, \"\[i\]f there were to be a smaller majority, say 55 or 65
percent, the PNG government could have found a way to justify really
stretching this out and having a period of negotiation that could last
years or decades. Now with such a phenomenal majority, it's much harder
for them to do that.\"[^40]

Damien Cave of *[The New York Times](The_New_York_Times "wikilink")*
reported that the referendum would serve as an inspiration for the [West
Papua independence movement](Free_Papua_Movement "wikilink") in
[Indonesia](Indonesia "wikilink") and for voters in the [2020 New
Caledonian
referendum](2020_New_Caledonian_independence_referendum "wikilink") for
independence from [France](France "wikilink"). Cave noted that, as with
other Pacific countries, Bougainville will likely make pleas to
[Australia](Australia "wikilink") and [New
Zealand](New_Zealand "wikilink") for assistance in developing its
institutions while [China](China "wikilink") and potentially the [United
States](United_States "wikilink") may offer diplomatic and economic
partnerships once independence is achieved.[^41] China is seeking to
incorporate an independent Bougainville into its [Belt and Road
Initiative](Belt_and_Road_Initiative "wikilink").[^42]

## Negotiations

Negotiations on the outcome of the referendum began on 17 May 2021.[^43]
Bougainville President [Ishmael Toroama](Ishmael_Toroama "wikilink"),
who took over from Momis in 2020, stated his wish to see Bougainville
become independent by June 2025.[^44] Marape for his part cautioned
against setting a specific timetable.[^45] While Marape and his
government have recognized the results of the referendum, he has
expressed reluctance at granting Bougainville independence for fear it
will potentially result in the breakup of the country. Toroama warned
that anything short of independence was not an option for
Bougainville.[^46]

In the meantime, Toroama launched the Independence Ready Mission to
prepare the region for independence. He expressed hope of obtaining
self-government by 2022, a prelude to full sovereignty.[^47][^48] On 7
July 2021, Toroama and Marape announced that the region will become
independent by 2027.[^49][^50] However, the agreement requires
ratification from Papua New Guinea\'s parliament before the region is
granted independence.[^51] In early December 2021, Toroama appealed for
the process to advance, expressing dissatisfaction over the pace of
negotiations.[^52] This led to a joint statement by Marape and Toroama
on giving Bougainville independence between 2025 and 2027 via a
framework known as the Era Kone Covenant that will detail the
constitutional process, seek approval from both Papua New Guinea and
Bougainville\'s cabinets by 31 January 2022, and begin two months later
if accepted.[^53] On 25 February 2022 a commission was sworn in to draft
a constitution for Bougainville.[^54] In April 2022, the Autonomous
Bougainville Government and the Government of Papua New Guinea finalised
the Era Kone Covenant on the mechanisms by which the Parliament of Papua
New Guinea will ratify the referendum results. Under the terms of the
agreement, the ratification process should begin in 2023 with
independence occurring no earlier than 2025 and no later than
2027.[^55][^56]
